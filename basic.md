# Rust Programming Language: Fundamentals and Real-Life Examples
 
## Rust is a systems programming language that focuses on safety, performance, and concurrency. It was initially developed by Mozilla Research and is designed to be a safe, concurrent, and fast language for building systems software, such as operating systems, web browsers, game engines, and more. Rust has gained significant popularity due to its unique approach to memory safety, which prevents common programming errors like null pointer dereferences and data races.


1. Variables and Data Types
In Rust, variables are immutable by default, which means their values cannot be changed once assigned. To declare a mutable variable, you use the mut keyword:

```rust

 let x = 5; // Immutable variable  
 let mut y = 10; // Mutable variable  
 y = 20; // Valid assignment 
 ```  

## Rust has several primitive data types, including integers (i8, i16, i32, i64, u8, u16, u32, u64), floating-point numbers (f32, f64), booleans (bool), and characters (char). It also supports compound data types like arrays and tuples.

```rust

 let age: u32 = 25; // Unsigned 32-bit integer 
let weight: f32 = 68.5; // 32-bit floating-point number
 let is_student: bool = true; // Boolean value 
  let name: char = 'A'; // Character 

```

 ## 2. Functions and Control Flow
Functions in Rust are defined using the fn keyword, followed by the function name, parameters (if any), and a return type. The main function is the entry point of a Rust program.

```rust

fn add(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 { 
 x + y
 }

 fn main() { 
   let sum = add(3, 5);  
 println!("The sum is: {}", sum); // Output: The sum is: 8 
 }  
 
 ```


## Rust supports common control flow constructs like if statements, loop and while loops, and pattern matching with match expressions.

```rust
let number = 7;

if number % 2 == 0 {
    println!("{} is even", number);
} else {
    println!("{} is odd", number); // Output: 7 is odd
}

let mut counter = 0;
loop {
    counter += 1;
    if counter > 5 {
        break;
    }
    println!("Counter: {}", counter);
} 

``` 

## 3. Ownership and Borrowing
Rust's ownership model is a key feature that ensures memory safety and prevents data races. Every value in Rust has a single owner, and when the owner goes out of scope, the value is automatically deallocated. This concept is known as Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII).

 
 ```rust

{
    let s = String::from("hello"); // s is valid from this point
    // do stuff with s
} // s goes out of scope and is automatically dropped

 ```

 
 Borrowing allows you to access and use data without taking ownership. Rust uses references (&) for borrowing, ensuring that there is only one mutable reference or any number of immutable references to a value at any given time.
 
  ```rust
  
 fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");
    change(&mut s); // Mutable borrow
    println!("{}", s); // Output: world
}

fn change(text: &mut String) {
    *text = String::from("world");
}
 
 ```

 ## 4. Structs and Enums
Structs and enums are compound data types in Rust that allow you to create your own custom types.
Structs are used to group related data together:

  ```rust

struct Person {
    name: String,
    age: u32,
}

fn main() {
    let person = Person {
        name: String::from("Alice"),
        age: 30,
    };
    println!("Name: {}, Age: {}", person.name, person.age);
}


  ```


  Enums are used to represent a set of possible variants:

```rust 

  enum Color {
    Red,
    Green,
    Blue,
    RGB(u8, u8, u8),
}

fn main() {
    let color = Color::RGB(255, 0, 0);
    match color {
        Color::Red => println!("It's red!"),
        Color::Green => println!("It's green!"),
        Color::Blue => println!("It's blue!"),
        Color::RGB(r, g, b) => println!("RGB values: {}, {}, {}", r, g, b),
    }
}
```

## 5. Traits and Generics
Traits in Rust are similar to interfaces in other languages, defining a set of methods that a type must implement. Traits are used to define shared behavior across types.

```rust 

trait Area {
    fn area(&self) -> f64;
}

struct Rectangle {
    width: f64,
    height: f64,
}

impl Area for Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> f64 {
        self.width * self.height
    }
}

fn main() {
    let rect = Rectangle {
        width: 5.0,
        height: 3.0,
    };
    println!("Area: {}", rect.area()); // Output: Area: 15.0
}



Generics allow you to define code that works with different types, making your code more reusable and flexible.

struct Container<T> {
    value: T,
}

fn main() {
    let int_container = Container { value: 42 };
    let string_container = Container { value: String::from("hello") };
}

```

## 6. Error Handling
Rust uses the Result type to handle errors, which can either be Ok or Err. This allows for explicit error handling and prevents the need for null checks.


```rust 

use std::fs::File;
use std::io::Error;

fn read_file(path: &str) -> Result<String, Error> {
    let mut file = File::open(path)?;
    let mut contents = String::new();
    file.read_to_string(&mut contents)?;
    Ok(contents)
}

fn main() {
    let result = read_file("example.txt");
    match result {
        Ok(contents) => println!("File contents: {}", contents),
        Err(error) => println!("Error reading file: {}", error),
    }
}
```

## 7. Concurrency and Parallelism
Rust provides built-in support for concurrency and parallelism through features like threads and message passing. The std::thread module allows you to create and manage threads.

```rust 
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    let handle = thread::spawn(|| {
        for i in 1..10 {
            println!("Thread: {}", i);
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(100));
        }
    });

    for i in 1..5 {
        println!("Main thread: {}", i);
        thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(200));
    }

    handle.join().unwrap();
}

```


Rust also provides a message passing library called std::sync::mpsc (multi-producer, single-consumer) for safe communication between threads.
